# Spring Framework Tutorial README
## Welcome to the Spring Framework tutorial repository! This repository contains branches covering various aspects of the Spring Framework.

## Branches
### 1. Annotation Based
Explore the Annotation Based branch to learn about using annotations for configuring Spring applications. Discover how to leverage annotations such as @Autowired, @Component, @Controller, @Service, @Repository, and more to simplify the configuration and development process.

### 2. Dependency Injection
Delve into the Dependency Injection branch to understand the core concept of dependency injection in the Spring Framework. Learn how to design loosely coupled and highly cohesive applications by injecting dependencies into beans rather than hardcoding them. Explore different types of dependency injection, including constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection.
